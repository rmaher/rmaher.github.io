					<h3>Rachel Maher</h3>
					<h2>Who are you?<h2>
						<p>I am an aspiring designer/developer looking to learn new things and grow my aquired skills. My background has spanned industries and tasks which has taught me to pick up ideas and work well with all kinds of people. Currently, the helpdesk for a scholarly publishing company is my domain. Is there a better way to understand the pitfalls and benefits of design and UX/UI? I think not. I see every day, firsthand, what works and what doesn't. I try and learn new things all the time. <br>Please take a look around the site and feel free to <a href = "rcontact.html">contact me</a> via social media. I will dicuss anything from job opportunities to philosophical conundrums to the best episodes of old TV shows. Look forward to hearing from you!</p>
